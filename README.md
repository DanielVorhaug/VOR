# VOR

## Q & A:

## What is VOR?
VOR (VOR has Only Recursion) is a strictly recursive programming language.

## How is VOR's syntax?
Think C++, but with no other functions than main(). That's about all you need to know.

## Isn't it a bit of a stretch calling VOR a programming language when it's just C++ with extra rules?
Probably.

## Who is VOR made for?
VOR is made for the enlightened ones that have realized recursion is all one needs. Other functions? That's just bloat. All you need is main() and recursion.

## Should I start using VOR in my programming projects?
Not really.

## What are the prerequisites for compiling VOR code?
- python
- g++

## How do I use the VOR compiler?
Call the compiler python script with the target file as the argument. For example:
`python .\VOR.py "main.vor"`
